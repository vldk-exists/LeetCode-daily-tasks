/*
You are given a string of length 5 called time, representing the current time on a digital clock in the format "hh:mm". The earliest possible time is "00:00" and the latest possible time is "23:59".

In the string time, the digits represented by the ? symbol are unknown, and must be replaced with a digit from 0 to 9.

Return an integer answer, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every ? with a digit from 0 to 9.
